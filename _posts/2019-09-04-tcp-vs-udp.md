## **TCP and UDP protocols**
**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
>is connection-oriented protocol means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting data.

All TCP connections begin with a **three-way handshake:**

**SYN**
>Clients pick a random sequence number x and sends a SYN packet, which may also include additional TCP flags and options.

**SYN ACK**
>Server increments x ny one, picks own random sequence number y, appends its own set of flags and options, and dispatches the response.

**ACK**
Client increments both x and y by one and completes the handshake by dispatching the last ACK packet in the handshake.


## **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
>it is unreliable and connectionless protocol. There is no need to establish connection prior to data transfer. UDP has attributes that make it advantageous for use with applications that can tolerate lost data.

- it allows packets to be dropped and received in a different order than they were transmitted, making it suitable for real-time applications where latency might be a concern.
- it can be used where a large number of clients are connected and where real-time error correction isn't necessary, such as gaming, voice or video conferencing, and streaming media.
